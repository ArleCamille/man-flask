# `man-flask`
## Overview
This project serves your system's `man` pages online. This project serves much
the same purpose as its predecessor, [`dwww`](
    https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dwww/dwww.1.en.html), with the only
exception that this project is powered by a more modern web framework called
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) such that more modern web servers
like Nginx can handle this project.
